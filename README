Prerequisites
-------------

Please ensure these Python packages are available on your server:

*   Django, http://djangoproject.com: ``easy_install -U django`

    We developed on Django 1.3.0; earlier versions may also work.

*   Pygments, http://pygments.org: ``easy_install -U pygments``

    We used version 1.4 during development; earlier versions may also work.

*   South, http://south.aeracode.org/: ``easy_install -U south``

    We used version 0.7.3 during development; earlier versions may also work.

*   Sphinx, http://sphinx.pocoo.org: ``easy_install -U sphinx``

    We used version 1.1 during development because it handles MathJax.

    Note that the Sphinx requirement might seem to be a bit of an overkill
    for comment compiling. We use it though because it handles math nicely
    (a requirement for scientific commenting), and formats all manner of
    bullets, paragraphs, tt-text, etc. ``rst2html`` from ``docutils`` might
    be a better, lightweight substitute in the future.

*   Haystack search, http://haystacksearch.org at version 1.2.0

    *   git clone https://github.com/toastdriven/django-haystack.git
    *   cd django-haystack
    *   git checkout 00a23e0cd6ac533073c2  # version 1.2.0; not 2.0.0-alpha
    *   python setup.py install
    *   Edit the ``search_settings.py`` file under ``deploy`` to customize
        the search options.

    We use the Xapian backend with Haystack:

    *   See the installation instructions at
        http://docs.haystacksearch.org/dev/installing_search_engines.html

        although installation in a hosted environment will require more work.

        (We use Xapian version 1.2.6 on our dev and production servers)

    *   After installing Xapian, also install:

        *   ``git clone git://github.com/notanumber/xapian-haystack.git``
        *   Symlink the ``xapian_backend.py`` file in the above repo to
            ``haystack/backends/xapian_backend.py`` location.

*   User registration, https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/

    *   hg clone http://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/
    *   cd django-registration
    *   python setup.py install

*   Python Imaging Library (for screenshot handling)

    *   This is a requirement for Django and Sphinx.


Not required yet (might be as we add more functionality to the site):

*   easy_install python-openid

Installation
--------------

#.  Cloning the SciPy Central code repository:

    ``git clone https://github.com/kgdunn/SciPyCentral.git``

#.  Ensure the following Django settings are in your ``settings.py`` file:

    *   ``CSRF_FAILURE_VIEW = 'scipy_central.pages.views.csrf_failure'``
    *   ``ROOT_URLCONF = 'deploy.urls'``
    *   ``INSTALLED_APPS`` contains these apps:

        *   ``'django.contrib.auth'``
        *   ``'django.contrib.contenttypes'``
        *   ``'django.contrib.sessions'``
        *   ``'django.contrib.sites'``
        *   ``'django.contrib.messages'``
        *   ``'django.contrib.staticfiles'``
        *   ``'django.contrib.admin'``
        *   ``'django.contrib.admindocs'``
        *   ``'django.contrib.humanize'``
        *   ``'haystack'``
        *   ``'registration'``
        *   ``'south'``
        *   ``'scipy_central.filestorage'``
        *   ``'scipy_central.pages'``
        *   ``'scipy_central.person'``
        *   ``'scipy_central.submission'``
        *   ``'scipy_central.tagging'``
        *   ``'scipy_central.screenshot'``
        *   ``'scipy_central.pagehit'``

    *   ``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE = 'person.UserProfile'``
    *   ``ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS = 7``
    *   ``REGISTRATION_OPEN = True``
    *   ``LOGIN_URL = '/user/login/'``
    *   ``SPC = { ... }``: see which key-value pairs are required by examing
        the code in the ``settings.py`` file that is part of the SciPy
        Central code repository.
    *   ``JQUERY_URL = '...'``
    *   ``JQUERYUI_URL = '...'``
    *   ``JQUERYUI_CSS = '...'``
    *   ``ANALYTICS_SNIPPET = '...'``
    *   ``LOGGING = {...}``: you need a logger called ``scipycentral``, see
        more information at http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/logging
        and also see the ``settings.py`` file that is part of the SciPy
        Central code repository.


#.	``./manage.py syncdb``
#.  ``./manage.py migrate``          # to run the ``south`` db migrations
#.	``./manage.py loaddata sample``  # to load licenses, tags and other data
#.  ``./manage.py rebuild_index``    # to rebuild the Haystack search index
#.  or ``./manage.py update_index``


Backup and restore
------------------

There are 4 components to backup:

    #.  Database: use ``deploy/backup_site.py``
    #.  Repositories: use ``rsync`` and mirror ``SPC['storage_dir']``
        directory that you set in ``settings.py``
    #.  Raw image files: rsync the ``SPC['raw_image_dir']``
    #.  Resized images: rsync the ``SPC['resized_image_dir']``

To restore:

    #.  Delete your existing database.

    #.  Run: ``./manage.py syncdb`` to create the empty tables in the database.

    #.  ``./manage.py migrate`` to run the ``south`` db migrations

    #.  ``./manage.py reset contenttypes`` to remove the ``contenttypes``
        objects created by ``syncdb``, which will inevitibly clash with those
        restored from the database dump (in the next step). See
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/853796/problems-with-contenttypes-when-loading-a-fixture-in-django

    #.  ``./manage.py loaddata backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.json``

        which restores the json database dump created by ``backup_site.py`` in
        step 1 of the backup procedure.

    #.  Do a full mirror of the rsynced repositories to your new
        ``SPC['storage_dir']`` location. This storage contains hidden
        directories (.hg or .git directories).

    #.  Similarly, restore the mirror of the resized images (the raw images
        may optionally be restored).
